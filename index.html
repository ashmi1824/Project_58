        <p>It is my loveliest hobby to read books. When I was 3, I started to read books. When I read one of my books, I always go into the books' world. I mostly like to read story books. 99% of my cupboard is filled with my books.</p>

        <p> I always learn new words by reading. And I sometimes use those interesting and special words in my English. Whenever I have free time, I start to read one of my books. I have read books of different authors, like Roald Dahl, J.K.Rowling etc. I sometimes read books to spend time and then lose track of time. When I go to sleep sfter reading my books, it is already the midnight or later.</p>

        <p>Honestly I am a big fan of J.K.Rowling. I have read her books and I liked them. They are very interesting. And also I read very fast. Within 5 minutes, I read 3 or 4 pages. I have many other hobbies too. But this hobby is my oldest and the best hobby of mine.</p>

        <p>Books are also one of my best friends. It always helps me when I need it. It always spends time with me. I also made a bookmark for my best friend. When I sometimes do not get time to read my books, I always feel something empty space in my heart.</p>

        <p>I always look forward to read the books. Instead of watching too much television and ruining my eyes, I read books. I also take care of my books. Books are stuck with me like glue. It never can leave me and I never can leave it.</p>
